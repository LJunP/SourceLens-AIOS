# SourceLens AIOS Authority Index

This directory is the canonical control plane for the SourceLens AIOS migration.

## Domain authority

| Domain | Authority |
| --- | --- |
| mission, ICP, year-one outcome, non-goals and phase route | `STRATEGIC_CONSTITUTION.md` |
| current mutable facts, current phase status, evidence pointers and active blockers | `truth/project_state.yaml` |
| roles, authority, task lifecycle, memory and review | `MASTER_EXECUTION_PROTOCOL.md` |
| TaskSpec, baselines, datasets, metrics and research artifacts | `EVALUATION_PROTOCOL.md` |
| inherited-asset disposition | `MIGRATION_LEDGER.yaml` |
| accepted decision rationale | append-only ADRs |
| bounded P0 task contracts | `tasks/P0-04A_TRUTH_CONTAINMENT.yaml`, `tasks/P0-04B_SLICE_F_GATE_REPAIR.yaml`, `tasks/P0-04C_AUTHORITY_DECONTAMINATION.yaml`, `tasks/P0-05_BASELINE_SLICING.yaml` |
| P0 Founder Gate current decision | external hash-bound Decision Record referenced by `truth/project_state.yaml` |

There is no global "earlier file wins" rule. Each document is authoritative only in its domain. The Truth Registry may mirror strategic values for machines but cannot change them. Historical status boards, progress logs, handoffs and pre-v2.3 roadmaps override none of these domains.

Legacy material is excluded from default Agent context. It may be opened only when an active Task Contract cites the exact file as evidence input; an isolated retrieved fragment from a legacy file can never establish current truth, priority or authority.

## Current state

`P0 Strategic Foundation` is complete by Founder Gate decision. The accepted
checkpoint is immutable and the Long-term Goal is active. P1 and AIOS-P1-001 are
not authorized. The only current critical path is the governance-only post-Gate
authority transition and its independent verification.

The external P0-A audit is stored outside the Git worktree at:

`/Users/lijunpeng/Desktop/cc/project/.sourcelens-audit/p0-a-20260710-220800/`

## Evidence terms

- `DEFINED`: described in documentation or schema only.
- `IMPLEMENTED`: executable code exists.
- `TESTED`: relevant automated tests have passed against a known state.
- `GATE_PASSED`: a declared gate passed and its evidence is retained.
- `PRODUCTION_PROVEN`: repeated production evidence exists.

No lower level implies a higher level.

## Gate artifact

`P0_GATE.md` collects the P0 exit checklist and dirty-worktree recovery plan. It is derived from canonical truth and never overrides it.

`P0_INDEPENDENT_REVIEW.md` records the read-only CTO, Quality & Evaluation and Security review cycle. Its final control-plane PASS does not change the P0 `NO-GO` gate.

## Codex operator entry

`CODEX_MASTER_PROMPT.md` contains the startup, specialist dispatch, independent review and Founder decision prompts. It references the canonical files and does not store current facts.

Repository-level Codex startup is enforced by the root `AGENTS.md`. It is an
execution pointer to this authority index, not an additional authority.

## P0 contract drafts

The Founder accepted the checkpoint versions of TaskSpec, EnvironmentSnapshot,
SystemConfiguration, RunRecord and `BASELINE_ADAPTER_CONTRACT.md` as controlled P1
implementation definitions. Their acceptance does not make the P1 research harness
implemented, authorize P1, or establish a capability claim.
