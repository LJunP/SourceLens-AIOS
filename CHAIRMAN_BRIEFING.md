# SourceLens AIOS Founder Briefing

## Current decision

SourceLens AIOS v2.3 is frozen. The P0 Founder Gate is `PASS`; the accepted
checkpoint is the current technical and rollback baseline. P1 and AIOS-P1-001
remain separately `NOT AUTHORIZED`.

The only current objective is to complete and independently verify the narrow
post-Gate governance-only authority transition before any P1 authorization
decision. This transition does not reopen P0, modify the accepted checkpoint or
authorize feature development.

## What the project is

SourceLens AIOS is a trustworthy autonomous-agent infrastructure research platform using software engineering as its first validation environment.

The only year-one product is:

> Given an immutable repository revision and a bounded issue, produce the smallest defensible patch, verify it independently in isolation, and present a traceable and reversible Patch Evidence Package for human approval.

Repository Intelligence is the primary product moat. Evaluation and failure data are the scientific asset. Trust and evidence custody make execution usable.

## What is true now

- The inherited repository contains substantial analyzer, Java AST/graph, retrieval, Agent, execution, audit, sandbox, UI and release-gate assets.
- The inherited source worktree remains a large, dirty, read-only historical
  source state; it is not itself the current baseline. The accepted P0-05
  checkpoint is the reviewable and reproducible technical baseline.
- The latest local release package passed its declared local gate with five skips, but it does not prove exact-source reproducibility or production readiness.
- The existing 22-case retrieval corpus is regression evidence, not a benchmark.
- The current Agent and AutoRepair paths do not yet prove the full issue-to-independent-verification loop.
- No SourceLens capability is currently `PRODUCTION_PROVEN`.

The exact current facts and evidence pointers are in `docs/aios/truth/project_state.yaml`.

## Team model

```text
Human Founder
  -> Master CEO Agent
       -> CTO Agent
       -> Chief AI Research Agent
       -> Product Intelligence Agent
       -> Engineering Manager Agent
       -> Quality & Evaluation Agent
       -> Security Agent
            -> temporary specialist workers
```

Roles are durable; physical Agent instances are temporary. One instance has one role, one task context and one bounded write scope. The implementer cannot independently verify its own result.

The Master coordinates and integrates; it does not routinely write all code or approve itself.

## Founder responsibilities

You decide only:

- mission, primary ICP or year-one outcome changes;
- phase gates;
- irreversible deletion;
- production/public/autonomous permissions;
- major cost, legal, privacy or commercial commitments;
- acceptance of critical residual risk.

Routine implementation, test failures, task decomposition and specialist selection belong to the Agent organization.

## Founder Gate result and next authorization boundary

The Human Founder has accepted the P0 checkpoint, migration dispositions,
controlled P1 contract definitions and retained Trust-risk register. That
decision completed the P0 Gate; it did not close the retained Trust risks or
authorize P1.

Before P1 can start, the post-Gate authority transition must pass independent
CTO, Security and Quality review, and the Founder must separately authorize both
P1 and an execution-ready, hash-frozen AIOS-P1-001 Task Contract. Until those
conditions are satisfied, do not start features, broad refactors, multi-Agent
construction, P1 research execution or production claims.

## Founder red lines

- A document label is not evidence.
- A focused smoke test is not a full capability claim.
- A local release gate is not production proof.
- A generated patch is not a verified task success.
- More Agents do not imply better performance.
- Transcript replay is not a measured memory system.
- Old P6/P9/P10/P11 plans cannot override v2.3.
- No deletion occurs in P0; use `CANDIDATE_ARCHIVE` until dependency, regression and Founder review are complete.

## What to read

1. `docs/aios/truth/project_state.yaml`
2. `docs/aios/STRATEGIC_CONSTITUTION.md`
3. `docs/aios/MASTER_EXECUTION_PROTOCOL.md`
4. `docs/aios/EVALUATION_PROTOCOL.md`
5. `docs/aios/MIGRATION_LEDGER.yaml`
6. `ROADMAP.md`

Legacy status boards, progress logs and handoffs are historical evidence only.

## Standard Founder instruction

```text
Read docs/aios/truth/project_state.yaml and obey the SourceLens AIOS v2.3 authority order.
Continue the current phase only.
Challenge why each task is needed now, use the smallest falsifiable step, dispatch one-role workers with disjoint ownership, require independent verification, update canonical truth only from evidence, and stop at the next Founder-reserved decision.
Do not add features, change strategy, delete assets or claim production readiness unless the current gate explicitly permits it.
```

## Next Founder decision

The P0 Founder Gate is `PASS`; the accepted checkpoint and open Trust risks are
recorded externally. P1 remains `NOT AUTHORIZED`. After the post-Gate authority
transition passes independent review, the next Founder decision is whether to
authorize P1 and the hash-frozen AIOS-P1-001 contract separately.
